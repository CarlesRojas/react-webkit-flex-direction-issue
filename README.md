# react-webkit-flex-direction-issue

Issue with -webkit-flex-direction and React
The -webkit-flex-direction does not appear in the browser.
All other properties work and update correctly, so it is not a problem about loading the css file.


The app was created using create-react-app.
The relevant files are
